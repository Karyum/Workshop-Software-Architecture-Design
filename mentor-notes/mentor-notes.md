# Notes For Mentors

Total Time: less than 1 hour

## Suggestions For Delivering the Workshop

#### Introducing the topic | Mentor presents to group & take questions | 5 mins
- Read through "What Is Software Architecture?" section of README


#### Exercise 1 | Mentor chooses two volunteers: one reads the bullet points one by one in Exercise 1, the other tries to represent each bullet point by drawing on the whiteboard | 10 mins
- Encourage others to call out ideas. Emphasise that there is no one right way to draw it.

#### Why whiteboard architecture? & Why Is Architecture Important? | Present to group & take questions | 5 mins

#### Exercise 2 | Working in pairs | 20 mins
Allow them at least 15 minutes to do this, but be flexible with timings.
Ask at least two teams to present their different approaches afterwards.

(If it seems like they could do with some help, you can show the file structure of one of your past projects. This brings up interesting questions.
E.g. "What is 'src'?", "What are 'public' and 'assets' folders?", "Why are those files at the root?")

*Wrap up!*
